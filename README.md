## About
Academic project for TCN 5080 at Florida International University

## Project Description
Create a program to encrypt and decrypt binary files using S-DES (Simplified DES) in the
Cipher Block Chaining mode. The program takes the input of an initial key and an initial
vector, reads the plaintext or ciphertext from a file, conducts the encryption or
decryption, and writes the resulting ciphertext or plaintext into a second file.
You can use any of your preferred programming languages and operating systems. A
test case is as follows: using a binary initialization vector of 10101010, a binary plaintext
of 00000001 00100011 encrypted with a binary key of 0111111101 should give a binary
ciphertext of 11110100 00001011. Decryption should work correspondingly.
